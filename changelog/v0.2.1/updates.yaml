    description: >
      Remove application resources that can't be rendered precisely and reproducibly as a dry run.
      For instance a DNS entry depends on a service being deployed and an external IP granted, which can't be
      determined prior to deploying the application. Imperative steps, like wait for a match on a field of a CRD,
      are moved into workflow steps. The ensure config now contains a set of steps for a cluster, rather than a set of
      applications.
