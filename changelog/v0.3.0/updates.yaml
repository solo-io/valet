    description: >
      Re-enable workflows. Workflows can now have steps that install or uninstall applications, wait for conditions, create DNS entries, curl endpoints, and more.
      Values can be passed into workflows and required by workflows. Workflows also propagate feature flags.

  - type: BREAKING_CHANGE
    description: >
      Remove application resources that can't be rendered precisely and reproducibly as a dry run.
      For instance a DNS entry depends on a service being deployed and an external IP granted, which can't be
      determined prior to deploying the application. Imperative steps, like wait for a match on a field of a CRD,
      are moved into workflow steps. The ensure config now contains a set of steps for a cluster, rather than a set of
      applications.

    description: >
      Values can now be prepended with "env:" to load the value from an environment variable (i.e. "env:AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"),
      or "template:" to render the template from the values (i.e. "template:{{ .OtherValueName }}"), or
      "key:" to use the value of a different key in the values map (i.e. "key:OtherValueName"). Values remain a
      map of string to string.
