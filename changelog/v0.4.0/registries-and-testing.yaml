changelog:
  - type: NON_USER_FACING
    description: Added tests for all application resources and workflow steps.
  - type: BREAKING_CHANGE
    description: >
      Instead of "path", use the "manifest" struct when defining an application resource from a particular local or remote file.
      This makes it easier to seamlessly support resources from other registries in the future.

    description: >
      Patches are no longer considered application resources, instead they can be defined as a workflow step. The structure of the
      patch resource stays the same.

  - type: NEW_FEATURE
    description: >
      A registry name flag was added to valet, and registries can be added to global config. When referencing another file in an
      application or workflow, a registry name can be provided. If that registry is known to the local valet command line, then
      the file can be loaded. Registries can be saved to the local valet command by adding to "$HOME/.valet/global.yaml".
