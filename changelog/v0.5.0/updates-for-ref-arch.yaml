    description: >
      (Experimental) Adds the `gen-docs` command for automatically generating documentation for valet workflows. The command takes
      an input workflow and outputs markdown documentation to stdout or optionally a file. Documentation is generated from
      a few fields on workflows and workflow steps. The `title` field is used to produce section headings, with the sections nested
      to mirror how the workflows are nested. The `description` field is used to produce one or more paragraphs and should be in
      markdown format. A workflow step with just descriptions could be useful for enriching the generated documentation.
      When steps apply certain types of resources (manifests, secrets, and templates so far), those resources are included in the
      docs. Create a value `RenderAsYaml: "true"` to render the underlying yaml, otherwise it will be rendered as a `kubectl` command.
      Use `docsValues` to override normal `values` when rendering the yaml, to redact some of the rendered yaml
      for documentation purposes.

    description: >
      Improve the user experience of `valet ensure --step` by using the docs titles in the prompts (and prompting before a step),
      to give the user a clear summary of the effect of hitting a key to continue.

    resolvesIssue: false
    description: Deprecates "registries" concept and `registryName` in yaml. It is hard to manage sprawling yaml registries, outweighing the cost of redundant yaml in different valet contexts.
  - type: NON_USER_FACING
    description: Migrate to eris for errors. Migrate to json tags instead of yaml tags, and ghodss for (strict) yaml unmarshalling, to support extended structs.
  - type: FIX
    description: Fix struct tag name for kubernetes version to "version" instead of "name".
